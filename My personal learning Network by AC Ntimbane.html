<a href="https://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> is a professional networking platform that allows individuals to connect with colleagues, build a professional online presence, and discover career opportunities. 

As an aspiring teacher, I have used LinkedIn to connect with fellow educators, share my educational achievements and experiences, and stay updated on industry trends, and seek career opportunities in the education field. For my path in learning support education, it connects me with experts and provides mentorship opportunities to enhance my understanding of special education. As an active volunteer, LinkedIn helps me find relevant non-profit organizations and causes for volunteer opportunities, ultimately contributing to my personal growth and community impact.

PowerPoint is a widely used software application developed by Microsoft that allows users to create multimedia presentations.

PowerPoint has been my go-to platform for creating engaging and visually appealing lesson presentations. It allows me to incorporate text, images and interactive videos, making the learning experience more fun and enjoyable for my students.
It comes in handy for creating accessible materials for students with varying abilities and learning challenges. I can include visual aids and audio cues to ensure that every student can access and understand the content.

 <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a></i> is an online platform that allows users to share and discover presentations, documents, infographics, videos, and other multimedia content.

It has been a fantastic source for me to discover and adapt teaching materials, especially when I've needed fresh ideas for my classes. I was also able to share my own presentations and resources with a large audience. I used this app to create a repurposed presentation by using information from posted slides and thereafter I posted my repurposed presentation. I also use this platform to get simplified information on topics related to my subject content and to follow users who align with my profession or who are also interested in topics I am interested in.

I used it to create custom quizzes tailored to the specific topics I was teaching. These quizzes can be used for formative assessment, which helps me test my students' understanding of the material. The immediate feedback provided by Quizizz is helpful for identifying areas where students needed additional support.
Quizizz also offers a vast library of pre-made quizzes on a wide range of topics. I often used these to supplement my lessons or provide extra practice.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/">Google Forms</a> is a web-based application developed by Google that allows users to create, distribute, and analyze online surveys, questionnaires, and forms. It offers a user-friendly interface for designing custom forms with various question types, such as multiple-choice, short answer, and more.

I used it to create short quizzes and tests for my students. It enables me to gather responses efficiently, making it easy to assess their understanding, tailor my teaching to their needs, and track their progress. Google Forms allows me to design customized forms with various question types, from multiple-choice and short answer to file uploads. I can also include images and videos, enhancing the engagement and clarity of the content. Furthermore, Google Forms is cost-effective as it is part of the Google Workspace suite, and it's easy to use, even for those with limited technical expertise. This accessibility ensures that both my students and fellow volunteers can interact with the forms without any difficulties.
